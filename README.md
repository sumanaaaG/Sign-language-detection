The ASL gesture recognition project made use of Python, along with the set of libraries namely sklearn and scipy, to carry out the modules of machine learning and image processing, facilitating continuous hand-gesture detection and classification.
The wide range of libraries associated with Python was quite pivotal in the smooth execution of the entire course of the task, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

I started to work on the gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. This configuration would be able to easily detect a hand pose, as well as the landmarks, nearly in real-time. 
OpenCV managed to get the image processing through capturing and manipulating the data resulting from the images. Google's MediaPipe provides pre-trained models that led to quick extraction of hand landmarks, so generating key features required for classification much faster. 
All these parts enabled us to pay more attention to the efficiency and precision of gesture recognition.

The machine learning model used here was a Random Forest Classifier, which is a very simple and efficient method.
Using the Python-based library Scikit-learn, Random Forest Classifier showed an impressive 97.2% accuracy for the classification of ASL gestures.

The Random Forest algorithm performed very well when multiple decision trees were created based on the feature, which was extracted to classify gestures through ensemble learning.
A great generalization by the model meant that it performed well on unseen data and, thus, could avoid overfitting while achieving good performance across multiple datasets. 
The very integration of these libraries successfully made the project -from gesture capturing up to effective classification-scalable and very efficient in the process. It shows that with due support from the right framework, Python may empower more rugged real-time ASL recognition while offering commendable accuracy and speed in gesture detection.
